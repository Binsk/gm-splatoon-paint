# About

A proof-of-concept and 'just for fun' project that aims to implement the basic idea of Splatoon's 3D splat system; both in terms of rendering and character movement.

As GameMaker is not a 3D engine this project will have a lot of extra elements as well in order to load in and render 3D resources but it will be tailored only to what is necessary to demonstrate this tech demo.

# Platform

At the time of this commit I am developing this solely for Linux, in my spare time, and only as a project to relieve stress and have some fun. It is very likely I will go through and make sure this runs on Windows at some point but it is not my goal at the moment.
