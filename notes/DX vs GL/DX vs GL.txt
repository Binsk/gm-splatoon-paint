There are a number of differences between OpenGL and DirectX and GameMaker
doesn't compensate for any of them, it seems, and my knowledge of their
intricacies is not where it should be.

OpenGL uses a right-handed coordinate system and column-major matrices.
DirectX uses a left-handed coordinate system and row-major matrices.

GameMaker's matrix generation doesn't change between platforms and it converts
GLSLES shaders to HLSL automatically (of which, the extent it handles the matrix
transposes I am unsure). 

I designed the systems Linux-first and only made things work with Windows half-
heartedly. A number of things needed to be jankily adjusted with the projection
matrix as well as screen-to-projection coordinates when calculating rays.

The point being, the way rendering is handled is extremely janky and could be
addressed much better than it is for multi-platform support, but I don't have
enough know-how to do so elegantly.

Maybe someday GameMaker will actually switch to Vulkan and fix most of these
inconsistencies. :)
