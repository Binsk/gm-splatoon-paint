Splat surfaces have some limitations and design requirements in order to work 
correctly. These could be overcome with some more complex designs, but
is beyond the scope of this project.

Note:  Splat maps share the UV coordinates of the mesh's original texture.

1. No 2 triangles can overlap UV coordinates as this will cause splatter in
   more than 1 place when any of the overlapping triangles are hit.
   
2. Splat maps are square and require roughly proportional UV mapping to the
   surface. Having a texture 'stretched' due to odd UV-mapping will cause the
   splat effect to be stretched as well.
   
3. Splat maps use a specific detail level (aka. resolution) which must be taken
   into account when drawing the splat to the buffer otherwise some surfaces
   will have larger / smaller splat effects.
   
4. It is possible for splat painting to overlap part of the UV map onto another
   part of the UV map, making splats able to 'overlap' to other parts of the mesh.
   This should be considered when creating the layout of the UV map.
